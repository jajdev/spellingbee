# Overview
Algorithms to create and solve the Spelling Bee word puzzle

# v1.0
The first algorithm finds all possible spelling bee pantagrams, using the system dictionary in an Apple Macbook. The second algorithm finds all possible spelling bee words for a given set of letters. This was written 23 July 2023, so the given set of letters is for that day. Output from the second algorthm is provided in an output txt file.

# v1.1
Provide an implementation of the algorithm in Java. (Work In Progress)

# v1.2
Provide an implementation of the algorithm in Go. (Work In Progress)

# v2.0
Create a class structure for these algorithms. Create a user interface to provide inputs for the given set of letters. (Work In Progress)
